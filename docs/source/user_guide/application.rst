Categories
----------

Categories define groups of related tests.

In the interactive app, each category defines a tab, containing a brief description of
the category, a table summarising its tests' scores, and a sections for each of its
tests.

The categories' summarising tables also provide category scores, which are all
presented in the ``Summary`` tab, in addition to overall set of scores.
