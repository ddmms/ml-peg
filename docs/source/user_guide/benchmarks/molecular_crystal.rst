Summary
-------

Performance in predicting lattice energies for 23 molecular crystals.


Metrics
-------

1. Lattice energy error

How accurate lattice energy predictions are.

For each molecular crystal, lattice energy is calculated by taking the difference
between the energy of the solid molecular crystal divided by the number of molecules it
comprises, and the energy of the isolated molecule. This is compared to the reference
lattice energy.


Computational cost
------------------

Low: tests are likely to take less than a minute to run on CPU.
