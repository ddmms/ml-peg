Summary
-------

Performance in predicting relative conformer energies of 12 C12H26,
16 C16H34 and 20 C20H42 conformers. Reference data from PNO-LCCSD(T)-F12/ AVQZ calculations.

Metrics
-------

1. Conformer energy error

For each complex, the the relative energy is calculated by taking the difference in energy
between the given conformer and the reference (zero-energy) conformer. This is
compared to the reference conformer energy, calculated in the same way.

Computational cost
------------------

Low: tests are likely to take minutes to run on CPU.
