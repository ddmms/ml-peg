Liquid densities
================

Summary
-------

Performance in predicting densities for 61 organic liquids, each system consisting of
about 1000 atoms. The dataset covers aliphatic, aromatic molecules, as well as different
functional groups and halogenated molecules.

Metrics
-------

1. Density error

For each system, the density is calculated by taking the average density of an NPT molecular
dynamics run. The initial part of the simulation, here 500 ps, is omitted from the density
calculation. This is compared to the reference density, obtained from experiment.

Computational cost
------------------

Low: tests are likely to take several days to run on GPU.
