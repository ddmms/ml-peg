Liquid densities
================

Summary
-------

Performance in predicting densities for 61 organic liquids, each system consisting of
about 1000 atoms. The dataset covers aliphatic, aromatic molecules, as well as different
functional groups and halogenated molecules.

Metrics
-------

1. Density error

For each system, the density is calculated by taking the average density of an NPT molecular
dynamics run. The initial part of the simulation, here 500 ps, is omitted from the density
calculation. This is compared to the reference density, obtained from experiment.

Computational cost
------------------

Very high: tests are likely to take several days to run on GPU.

Water ethanol density curves
============================

Summary
-------

Benchmark of the density of water-ethanol mixtures for different concentrations of ethanol, compare to experiment.
1 ns of NPT MD on about 120 water/ethanol molecules for 6 concentrations.

Metrics
-------

1. rms of the density difference.
2. rms of the excess volume difference.
3. Concentration of the minimal excess volume.


For each system, the density is calculated by taking the average density of an NPT molecular
dynamics run. The initial part of the simulation, here 500 ps, is omitted from the density
calculation. This is compared to the reference density, obtained from experiment.
The excess volume is computed as the difference between the actual molar volume of the mixture and the ideal molar volume obtained by linear combination of the pure-component molar volumes.
The concentration of the minimal excess volume is estimated by fitting a quadratic to the three grid points surrounding the minimum and taking the vertex of the parabola.

Computational cost
------------------

Very high: tests are likely to take several days to run on GPU.

Ring planarity
==============

Summary
-------

Performance in maintaining planar aromatic rings during molecular dynamics of small
organic molecules. For each molecule, an NVT molecular dynamics simulation is run at 300 K
starting from a QM-optimised reference geometry (selected from QM9), and the deviation of
the ring atoms from their best-fit plane is measured along the trajectory.

Metrics
-------

1. Planarity deviation

At each frame of the trajectory, the ring atoms are fitted to a plane and the root mean
square deviation of the atoms from that plane is calculated. This is averaged over the
trajectory and across all molecules. Aromatic rings are planar, so a well behaved potential
keeps this deviation small; a lower deviation is better.

A histogram shows the distribution of the sampled planarity deviations for each model.

Computational cost
------------------

High: one MD simulation per molecule, each 1,000,000 steps. Faster inference can be achieved
using the jax-accelerated simulations in MLIP Audit directly.

Data availability
-----------------

Input structures:

* MLIP Audit benchmark suite, InstaDeep. Reference geometries selected from the QM9 dataset
  (Ramakrishnan et al., Scientific Data 1, 140022, 2014).

Reference data:

* QM-optimised reference geometries of the aromatic molecules.
