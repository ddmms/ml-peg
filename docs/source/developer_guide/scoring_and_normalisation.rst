Benchmark scoring and normalisation
=================


This guide will break down how benchmark metrics are scored and normalised by default and how users can specify their own normalisation schemes.
Normalisation of benchmark metrics to yield a unitless score is essential if we want to combine multiple metrics of different units and order of magnitude into a single overall benchmark score.



Custom scoring and normalisation
-------------------

the dev would need to clearly document it in the user guide too

I.e. if you use a non-standard normalisation, you need to make it clear to users
