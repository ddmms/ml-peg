Welcome to ML-PEG's documentation!
========================================

ML-PEG is an ML potential usability and performance guide.

We host a `live instance <https://ml-peg.stfc.ac.uk>`_ of ML-PEG, with the latest
models and benchmarks, as well as providing tools to develop your own benchmarks. These
may be contributed back to ML-PEG, or you can host your own version of the application.
