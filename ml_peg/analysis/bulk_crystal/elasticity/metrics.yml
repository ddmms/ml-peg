metrics:
  Bulk modulus MAE:
    good: 2.0
    bad: 30.0
    unit: GPa
    tooltip: Mean absolute error of VRH bulk modulus (lower is better). Plot annotations list how many systems were excluded.
  Shear modulus MAE:
    good: 2.0
    bad: 30.0
    unit: GPa
    tooltip: Mean absolute error of VRH shear modulus (lower is better). Plot annotations list how many systems were excluded.
