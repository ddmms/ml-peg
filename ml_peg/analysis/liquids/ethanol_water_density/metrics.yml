# TODO: the 'bad' defaults are quite arbitrary so pick decent ones; should I log rescale?
# TODO: add more metrics? e.g. radial distribution (or diffusion).
metrics:
  RMSE density:
    good: 0.0003  # approximate error of the reference on the coarse, sampled grid
    bad: 0.02
    unit: g cm^-3
    tooltip: "RMSE between model and reference densities at the sampled compositions"
    level_of_theory: experiment

  RMSE excess density:
    good: 0.0003  # approximate error of the reference on the coarse, sampled grid
    bad: 0.01
    unit: g cm^-3
    tooltip: "RMSE of excess (non-ideal) density after subtracting linear mixing baseline"
    level_of_theory: experiment

  Peak x error:
    good: 0.005  # approximate error of the reference on the coarse, sampled grid
    bad: 0.20
    unit: mole fraction
    tooltip: "Absolute error in the mole-fraction location of maximum excess density"
